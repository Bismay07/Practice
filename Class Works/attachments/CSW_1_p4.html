		<h3> What is Lunacy</h3>
		<p><b>Lunacy is a next-gen vector graphic software for UI, UX, and web design.</b> It has everything you are used to in other similar apps 			and goes beyond. Created by designers for designers to focus on the workflow and minimize distractions. No more wasting time surfing the 			internet for graphics or switching apps to remove backgrounds, or thinking placeholder texts. Lunacy has it all and even more. Faster than 			Figma, smarter than Sketch!</p>
